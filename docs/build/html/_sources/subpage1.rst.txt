Spherical Harmonics
-----------------------

A spherical harmonics model, the user can specify the co-eficients for as many terms as desired. Spherical harmonics models are useful, since they do not make any physical assumptions about the distribution you wish to recover. It can be useful to check the results of a physically motivated model against the results of a spherical harmonic fit. Called with "spherical".

main parameters:

    **degree**
        The maximum degree of Harmonic you want to consider (You won't typically want more than 2)

    **la0**
        Offset of the center of the co-ordinte centre from the substellar point in the latitude direction (unit: Degrees)

    **lo0**
        Offset of the center of the co-ordinte centre from the substellar point in the longitude direction (unit: Degrees)

    **sph**
        A list of the co-efficients for the harmonic terms, there *must* be the appropriate number (degree squared), and arranged in the correct order: [l0, l1 m-1, l1 m0, l1 m1, l2 m-2, l2 m-1, l2 m0, l2 m1, l2 m2..... etc]. These parameters are scaled to be relative to the stellar flux, so will typically be of order 1e-3 - 1e-4.

.. warning:: There is nothing implicit in this spherical harmonics implementation to prevent negative surface fluxes! It is suggested that care is taken when specifying priors to prevent unphysical results.
